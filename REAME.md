# PESAPAL Junior Developer ('23) Challenge.

## [Link](https://pesapal.freshteam.com/jobs/2OU7qEKgG4DR/junior-developer-23)

## Requirements.
All solutions in this repo use typescript, they have been tasted on:
- Nodejs version v18.12.1 (with npm and npx though npx is optional)
- Typescript version 4.9.5

Versions above the above requirements should be able to run.

## Setup
Before running any solution make sure you have run the following command:
```shell
npm install
```
This command would work if you have nodejs installed in your OS with npm that should come with it out of the box.

## Questions answered.
- [Quesion 0 all parts](./q0)
- [Question 4](./q4)

Clicking on the links should direct you to the respective folders with the solutions, with information on how to run them and more.

## Why Typescript?
- At first, I was thinking of doing the questions in Rust or C, but then decided to check on another of my projects to see what are the currently trending languages used by Kenyans over at this [link](https://borwe.github.io/wakaflame/languages) based on [wakatime](https://wakatime.com/) data, And then the language with the most users was Javascript followed by Typescript. Typescript being the obvious better version with type checking it made more sense, hence I decided to go with Typescript.
